# emberjs_calendar
This is simple ember.js application which is simular jQuery.datepicker widget.
But this example doesn't work with textedit.
Our widget is a single page application for calendar management.

## Issues
- The goal is to render a monthly calendar with no entries. Just a calendar with day numbers and an active month name and year on the top.

- There should be some navigation buttons such as “next/previous month”, “next/previous year”, and “today”.

- Clicking on any day in the calendar selects it (highlights it).

- The current day, selected day, and other days should have their own css classes so that you can design them, but the css should be very simple, such as just different background colors.

- When landing on the index page, it should switch to the current day automatically (today).

- The URL has to be in this format: “/year/xxxx/month/yy/day/zz” where of course xxxx, yy and zz would be the year, month and day of the selected date.

- There should be a controller holding the selected date, and clicking on another date in the calendar should switch to that date (also in the URL) thanks to a route event.

- Currently on selecting any date the whole of month is updated. That's extremely visible on slow computers. Needed to update only dates which are part of selection process (old one and new one), if year and month are keeped the same.
